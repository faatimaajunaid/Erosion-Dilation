# Erosion-Dilation
Erosion and Dilation algorithm implementation in Matlab

Dilation adds pixels to the boundaries of objects in an image, while erosion removes pixels on object boundaries. The number of pixels added or removed from the objects in an image depends on the size and shape of the structuring element used to process the image.
